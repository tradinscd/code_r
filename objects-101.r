# R treats almost everything in the software as an object. Objects can be individual numbers to variable names to strings of plain text. Working in R meaning manipulating these objects to make them how you want them.

# In R, a collection of one or more values is called a vector. Think of vectors as a collection of numbers.

# We can create a vector by creating a variable
my.age <- 29 # create an vector variable called my.age that contains the value "29"
my.age # view the contents of our.ages
our.ages <- c(29, 29, 43, 4) # create a vector variable called our.ages containing the values 29, 29, 43, and 4
our.ages # view the contents of our.ages
