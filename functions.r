# Functions

# Functions are actions that R can do. Some actions are pre-set in R, but if they are not, we can create our own
add.together <- function(x,y) {x+y} # create a function called add.together, wherein it adds x and y (whatever those values are) together
add.together(2,5) # run add.together on 2 and 5
